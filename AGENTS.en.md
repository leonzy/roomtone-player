## Coding Conventions

- **State**: handwritten flutter_riverpod providers, **no** code generation/build_runner. Use `Provider`, `NotifierProvider`, and `FutureProvider` (including `AsyncNotifierProvider`).
- **Routing**: declarative go_router; `AppRoutes` constants and `redirect` auth guards.
- **HTTP**: Dio in `core/network/api_client.dart`; `AuthInterceptor` refreshes dual JWT tokens.
- **Theme**: Material 3, seed `indigo-500`; no hardcoded colors, use `Theme.of(context).colorScheme`.
- **Responsive**: Mobile < 600px, Tablet 600–900px, Desktop 900–1920px, TV >= 1920px.
- **Conditional imports**: stub/native pairs for Web-incompatible functionality, such as `plugin_webview_page.dart` / `_native.dart` / `_stub.dart`.
- **Imports**: relative paths (`../../`).
- **Lints**: `prefer_const_constructors`, `prefer_single_quotes`, `avoid_print`, `prefer_const_declarations` in `analysis_options.yaml`.
- **Features**: `features/<name>/data/` (API/Repository), `domain/` (state/business logic), `presentation/` (pages/providers/widgets).

## Deployment Modes

| Mode | Build flag | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| standalone | Default, no `--dart-define` | Separate frontend/backend; API address UI |
| embedded | `--dart-define=DEPLOY_MODE=embedded` | Same-origin backend embedding; API address UI hidden |

`AppConfig.isEmbedded` is compile-time and supports tree shaking; embedded Web derives a deployment subpath from `Uri.base.path`.

### Bundle Local Mode (HAS_BACKEND) and Update Repository

`--dart-define=HAS_BACKEND=true` enables `AppConfig.hasEmbeddedBackend` and a local Go backend. This is **orthogonal** to embedded `DEPLOY_MODE`: Bundle does not set embedded, so `isEmbedded=false` and the client-update settings tile remains visible.

**Standard and Bundle editions use different release repositories.**

| Edition | Release repository | Artifact | Builder |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard | `songloft-org/songloft-player` | `songloft-*.apk`, etc. | Local `build-and-release.yml` |
| Bundle | Parent `songloft-org/songloft` | `roomtone-bundled-*` | Parent `release.yml` |

- `FrontendVersionApi` uses compile-time `AppConfig.frontendUpdateRepo` (`hasEmbeddedBackend ? frontendBundleRepo : frontendRepo`), as does `frontendUpdateReleasesUrl`.
- Never hardcode `songloft-org/songloft-player` in updates: Bundle's injected `FRONTEND_VERSION` is a parent tag; the wrong repository mismatches comparison and installs the standard edition without the local backend.
- `frontendRepo` / `frontendReleasesUrl` retain their standard-edition meaning only for the Web-only download section in `client_download_page.dart`.

### Hot Updates (libapp.so and Bundle Android libgojni.so)

The authoritative unified Bundle model is [docs/en/backend_hotupdate.md](docs/en/backend_hotupdate.md).

- **No manually selected baseline, automatic publication**: check the latest release in the current channel (`dev` tag or stable `/releases/latest`, `channel_release_resolver.dart`). Each parent `build-bundled-android` run uploads frontend `patch-<abi>-<commit>.zip` + manifest and backend `libgojni-<abi>-<commit>.so` + backend manifest; no manual workflow.
- **One combined experience**: `PatchUpdateDialog.maybeShow` in `lib/core/updater/` checks both patches concurrently per session, lists/downloads them together, and restarts once via a real `EmbeddedBackendService.restartProcess` cold start. This applies libapp.so and lets `SongloftApplication` preload libgojni.so.
- **Startup gates and manual entry**: use session-persistent `ShellLayout`, not HomePage, so TV is included. First wait for authenticated via `ref.listenManual(authStateProvider)`, then schedule a cancellable 4-second `kPatchCheckStartupDelay` Timer. Checking mounted alone can let slow authentication consume the once-per-session opportunity and throttle window before login with an unauthenticated Dio. Dispose cancels the Timer rather than using Future.delayed. Respect `autoUpdateCheckProvider` (preference `auto_update_check_enabled`, default on) and the 6-hour `kPatchCheckThrottle` (`last_patch_check_at`). Bound the whole check to 45 seconds because proxy fallback can double request latency. Require `elapsed >= 0` so clock rollback cannot indefinitely suppress checks. If a patch is found after context disposal, roll back the throttle timestamp and log separately from “no patch”. The manual Settings → About & updates → Check client updates calls `maybeShow(manual: true)`, bypasses delay/throttling and the ignored-version list without clearing it, and does not write the throttle timestamp. Without a patch, fall back to `FrontendUpgradeDialog`'s existing three-state UI without an extra snackbar. Tests: `test/core/updater/patch_update_dialog_gates_test.dart`.
- **Compatibility keys replace versionCode** automatically: frontend uses the Flutter engine version (`AppConfig.flutterBinding` = CI `FLUTTER_VERSION`, manifest `flutterBinding`). Equal keys allow compatibility with `targetVersionCode=null` across versionCodes; mismatch needs a full package. Backend freezes the exported surface in parent `mobile/export_surface.txt` and release guards without versionCode.
- **Native contract hashes** prevent patched Dart calling methods missing in the installed APK. `com.songloft/contract` `getHash` returns `{dart,go}` computed by `scripts/compute_native_contract.sh`, embedded in APK assets and manifest `contractHash`. `contractHashBlocks` sends mismatches to full-package updates; either empty hash degrades without blocking. No manual constant bump; standard/Bundle Android use this, iOS does not.
- **Channel comparisons**: dev compares commit hashes, stable compares versions via `version_compare.dart`; native `BackendPatchManager` handles pending→confirmed rollback and blacklisting.
- Standard Android also has no manual baseline: local `build-and-release.yml` `build-android` publishes frontend patches/manifests automatically, without backend patches; `patch-release.yml` was removed. Constant pubspec `+N` versionCode and `flutterBinding` support cross-version compatibility. Old manifest formats remain supported.

### Kotlin Freeze Rules (Android Hot-Update Safety)

Keep the Dart contract hash generated by `compute_native_contract.sh` unchanged during ordinary iteration, avoiding blocked libapp.so updates and forced full APK downloads. This matters especially when the standard edition has no Go backend to extend.

**Hard rules:**

1. **Do not add MethodChannel method names** in Kotlin `when(call.method)`. The hash extracts `call.method == "x"` and `"x" ->`; additions change it.
2. **Extend existing parameter Maps**, such as `show` / `updateConfig`. Read with `call.argument<T>("newKey")`, default when absent. This preserves method names and the hash.
3. **Extend the existing `exec` escape method** in `FloatingLyricPlugin` using `cmd` for new capabilities that parameters cannot express. Dispatch with **if/else, never when**, whose `"x" ->` is captured by the hash. A null Dart response means the current APK does not support the command and should degrade gracefully.
4. **Prefer pure-Dart Flutter plugins**: adding/removing native plugins changes `GeneratedPluginRegistrant` and the hash.
5. **Required Kotlin changes count as full-package release events**. Mark the commit explicitly: `feat(android)!: add new native channel (breaks hot-update contract hash)`.

**Does not change the hash:**

- Kotlin→Dart `channel.invokeMethod` callbacks are not captured and may be extended.
- Adding `updateConfig` / `show` parameter Map keys.
- SharedPreferences keys used by widget data.
- New `exec` subcommands implemented with if/else.

## Git Conventions

- Investigate, implement, validate, and self-review continuously without stage approvals; ask only for essential missing information, product decisions, or scope expansion. Commits, pushes, formal releases, and Issue writes need distinct authorization; never repeat existing requests. Commit to main, children before parent pointers.
- Read relevant LESSONS before work and record evidence-backed experience afterward in Chinese/English. Three independent events on distinct dates make promotion candidates; repeated reviews do not increase counts. Existing hard rules apply immediately.
- Unresolved Issue triage includes parent and all submodules with recursive discovery, deduplication, and full pagination. Assess bodies/all comments/current code/validation; report gaps. Open does not prove unfixed.
- Bind validation to repository, SHA or uncommitted fingerprint, environment, and observed results; list relevant `Not run`. Changes require affected checks again. Web/simulations do not replace device acceptance of native audio, backgrounding, Bundle, or hot updates. See the [local AI workflow](docs/en/ai-development.md).

- **No** `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
- Conventional Commits: `type(scope): description`.
- Parent Issue references **must** use `songloft-org/songloft#NNN`; bare `#NNN` resolves to this repository.
