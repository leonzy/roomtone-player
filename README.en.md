  <strong>🎵 Roomtone Player — A cross-platform music player built with Flutter</strong>
</p>

Roomtone Player is a cross-platform music player built with Flutter, supporting iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, and Web. Supports **Bundle local mode**: embeds the Go backend directly into the client, no server deployment required.

Settings → Playback → Keep screen on for lyrics keeps the display awake while viewing lyrics. It is off by default and saved only on this device. Returning to the cover on mobile, leaving the player, or backgrounding the app restores automatic screen sleep. Wide players apply it while lyrics are visible, including when playback is paused. Web support depends on browser capabilities and permission; unavailable or denied requests do not interrupt playback.

## Download

Download the latest version from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/leonzy/roomtone-player/releases/latest):

Release bodies contain version changes and installation links to this section. Version history is maintained in the Chinese-only [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), updated automatically after a versioned release succeeds. See the table below for installation instructions.

This repository publishes the standard Flutter client, which connects to a [Roomtone server](https://github.com/leonzy/roomtone). Enter the server address and sign in after installation. For local mode with a bundled backend, download `roomtone-bundled-*` from the [main project releases](https://github.com/leonzy/roomtone/releases).

Choose a file for your device under **Assets** on the release page. Some packaging formats may be unavailable; check the attached files.

```

See [Build Guide](docs/en/build_guide.md) for details.

## CI/CD

This repository uses GitHub Actions for automated builds and releases:

- **Push `v*` tag** → Automatically build all platforms and create a Release
- **Manual trigger** → Build and publish to the branch-named Release (e.g. `main`)

## Deploy Modes

| Mode | Build Flag | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **standalone** | Default (no `--dart-define`) | Separated frontend/backend, shows API URL config UI for user to fill in |
| **embedded** | `--dart-define=DEPLOY_MODE=embedded` | Embedded with Go backend on same domain, auto uses current domain, hides API URL UI |
| **bundle** | `--dart-define=HAS_BACKEND=true` | Go backend embedded in client, no server needed, supports local/remote mode switching |

Default build (without `--dart-define`) is equivalent to standalone mode.

### Bundle Local Mode

The bundle version embeds the Go backend into the client, so users don't need a separate server:

- **Mobile (Android/iOS)**: Go backend compiled as native library (`.aar` / `.xcframework`) via gomobile, accessed through MethodChannel
- **Desktop (macOS/Windows/Linux)**: Go backend compiled as `songloft-server` executable, launched as a subprocess
- **Web**: Not supported for bundle mode

Usage: On first launch, tap "Use Local Mode" on the login page → select music directory → done. Switch between local/remote mode anytime in settings.

Pre-built bundle packages are available from [songloft main repo Releases](https://github.com/leonzy/roomtone/releases/latest) (`roomtone-bundled-*` files).

## Release

Use `bump-version.sh` for versioning (follows semantic versioning):

```bash
# Patch version bump (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
./scripts/bump-version.sh patch

# Minor version bump (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
./scripts/bump-version.sh minor

# Major version bump (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
./scripts/bump-version.sh major
```

The script will automatically:
- Read and bump the version in `pubspec.yaml`
- Create a Git tag (format: `v{version}`)
- Push the Git tag to remote
- Provide interactive confirmation and progress feedback

## Backend

**Standard version** requires the [Roomtone backend](https://github.com/leonzy/roomtone) service. Default connection: `http://localhost:58091`, configurable on the login page.

**Bundle version** embeds the Go backend, no separate server deployment needed. Auto-logs in with admin/admin.

Default credentials: admin / admin
