# Flutter Frontend Scripts Guide

This directory contains build and release scripts for the Roomtone Flutter frontend.

## 📋 Script List

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `build-frontend.sh` | Multi-platform build script, supports web/linux/windows/macos/android/ios/all |
| `bump-version.sh` | Release script (semantic versioning + Git tagging) |
| `docker-build-frontend.sh` | Docker build helper |
| `download-fonts.sh` | Font download script (downloads custom fonts used by the project) |
| `compute_native_contract.sh` | Hash plugins, MethodChannels and release ProGuard rules for hot-update compatibility |
| `check-android-preferences-jni.py` | Check the preferences plugin's JNI method descriptor in a release APK using Android SDK `apkanalyzer` |

After an Android release build, run `python3 scripts/check-android-preferences-jni.py <apk>` to verify JNI method descriptors and the Kotlin coroutine, result and Unit classes/members referenced by the JNI runtime. Both standard and Bundle release workflows check the ARM64, ARMv7 and x86_64 artifacts individually. Dart tests and debug APKs cannot replace it. ProGuard changes require a full APK; the native contract hash prevents old APKs from receiving only a Dart patch. Run script regressions with `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -p '*_test.py'`.

## 🔧 `bump-version.sh` — Versioning & Release

Automates the Flutter frontend version release process. **Unified release contract**: parameters and behavior are identical to `clients/player-lynx/scripts/bump-version.sh` and the parent repo's `scripts/bump-version.sh`, so the parent's `scripts/release-all.sh` can orchestrate them directly.

**Usage**:

```bash
# Patch version bump (bug fix, 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1, default)
./scripts/bump-version.sh patch

# Minor version bump (new feature, 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
./scripts/bump-version.sh minor

# Major version bump (breaking change, 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
./scripts/bump-version.sh major

# Formal release (strip pre-release suffix: 2.0.0-alpha.2 -> 2.0.0)
./scripts/bump-version.sh release

# Explicit new version (must be newer than the current one)
./scripts/bump-version.sh 2.1.0

# Dry run — preview only: no file changes, no tags, no network
./scripts/bump-version.sh minor --dry-run

# Skip the interactive confirmation / keep commit+tag local
./scripts/bump-version.sh patch --yes
./scripts/bump-version.sh patch --no-push

# Show help
./scripts/bump-version.sh --help
```

**What the script does**:

1. Reads the current version from `pubspec.yaml`
2. Computes the new version from the bump type (release/major/minor/patch) or the explicit argument; the new version must be newer
3. Preflight: on `main`, clean worktree, `v<new>` tag absent locally and remotely, local main contains `origin/main`
4. Updates `pubspec.yaml` version (preserving the `+build number`)
5. Git commit + annotated tag (`v{version}`) + `git push --atomic` of main and that tag in one shot

After the tag is pushed, `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml` automatically handles multi-platform builds and GitHub Release creation.

Release bodies contain automatically generated, categorized changes, with only installation links in `.github/release-notes.md`. Platform installation instructions are maintained in the root [README.md](../README.md#下载安装) and [README.en.md](../README.en.md#download). After a version-tag release succeeds, a separate job updates the Chinese-only root `CHANGELOG.md` from the latest `main` and commits it back to the repository. Rolling dev builds do not write this file. Changelog updates for different versions run serially and do not trigger another build.

**Safety features**:

- Any failed preflight exits before the first write; `--dry-run` performs no writes and no network calls
- Published tags are **never overwritten**; on failure the local state is kept (no tag deletion, no reset) for manual handling per this doc
- Use `--yes` in non-interactive environments; `--no-push` lets you verify locally and later run `git push --atomic origin HEAD:refs/heads/main refs/tags/v<version>` yourself
- The last stdout line prints `v<version>` while logs go to stderr, so the output chains cleanly (the parent's `release-all.sh` relies on this)

## 🔧 `build-frontend.sh` — Multi-Platform Build

```bash
# Build a single platform
./scripts/build-frontend.sh web              # Web standalone
./scripts/build-frontend.sh web-embedded     # Web embedded mode
./scripts/build-frontend.sh linux
./scripts/build-frontend.sh windows
./scripts/build-frontend.sh macos
./scripts/build-frontend.sh android
./scripts/build-frontend.sh ios

# Build all platforms
./scripts/build-frontend.sh all
```

Build artifacts are output to the `songloft-player-build/` directory.

## 📝 Semantic Versioning

Follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification:

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API or breaking changes
- **MINOR**: Backward-compatible new functionality
- **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes
- Version format: `X.Y.Z+W` (X=major, Y=minor, Z=patch, W=build number)
- The script only modifies `X.Y.Z`, preserving the build number
